# PS5StockHelper
Helps with getting a PS5.

The idea is you run this, and once there's stock your browser will automatically open the site so you can purchase the item. If you already have desktop notifications and/or Twitter notifications set up, this is not likely to be useful for you. On the other hand, if don't want to check whether the Tweets you're being notified about actually relate to PS5s, then this might be for you.

To be clear: this is NOT a bot to help you get through checkout quickly.

FYI: there are probably lots of edge cases I'm not handling. I just wanted something quick that would get the job done. If you can make it better, feel free to fork or submit a PR. Also, this is only focused on Canadian stock, although in principle it could easily be changed to work for stock in other countries too.

# Requirements
You need Python 3.8 so that snscrape will work.
